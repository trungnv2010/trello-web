# 📋 Trello Clone - Modern Project Management Tool

A sophisticated project management application built with **React.js** and **Node.js**, delivering a seamless Trello-like experience with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality and powerful collaboration features.


## ✨ Key Features

**Board & List Management**
Create unlimited project boards with customizable lists to organize your workflow. The intuitive interface allows you to structure your projects exactly how you envision them, whether following Kanban methodology or your own organizational system.

**Advanced Card System**
Each card serves as a comprehensive task container with rich text descriptions, color-coded labels for categorization, due date tracking, and file attachment capabilities. The system supports detailed task management while maintaining simplicity.

**Real-time Collaboration**
Invite team members to boards with granular permission controls including Owner, Admin, and Member roles. Assignment functionality ensures accountability, while real-time notifications keep everyone synchronized on project updates.

**Seamless Drag & Drop Experience**
Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality powered by React Beautiful DnD allows effortless movement of cards between lists and reordering within lists, making workflow management feel natural and responsive.

**Enhanced Productivity Tools**
Built-in search and filtering capabilities help you locate specific cards instantly. Activity history tracking provides complete project transparency, while data export functionality ensures your work is always accessible.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Frontend Architecture**
The client-side application leverages React.js 18 with modern hooks for component state management and lifecycle handling. Redux Toolkit manages global application state, ensuring predictable state updates across components. Material-UI provides a consistent, professional design system, while Axios handles all HTTP communications with the backend API.

**Backend Infrastructure**
The server runs on Node.js with Express.js framework, providing robust API endpoints and middleware support. MongoDB serves as the primary database with Mongoose ODM for elegant data modeling and validation. JWT tokens handle secure user authentication, while Bcrypt ensures password security through proper hashing.

**Real-time Communication**
Socket.io enables bidirectional real-time communication between clients and server, ensuring instant updates when team members modify boards, move cards, or post comments.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

**Prerequisites**
Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or higher) and npm installed on your system. You'll also need MongoDB running locally or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster for database connectivity.

**Backend Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install all required dependencies
npm install

# Create environment configuration file
cp .env.example .env

# Configure your environment variables in .env file
# Include MongoDB connection string, JWT secret, and port configuration

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

**Frontend Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install all required dependencies
npm install

# Create environment configuration file
cp .env.example .env

# Configure API endpoint in .env file
# Set REACT_APP_API_URL to your backend server URL

# Start the development server
npm start
```

**Environment Configuration**
Your backend .env file should include essential configurations such as your MongoDB connection string (MONGODB_URI), JWT secret key (JWT_SECRET), server port (PORT), and any third-party service API keys. The frontend .env file primarily needs the backend API URL configuration.

## 🔧 API Documentation

**Authentication Endpoints**
The API provides comprehensive authentication including user registration, login, password reset, and profile management. All protected routes require valid JWT tokens in the Authorization header.

**Board Management**
Board endpoints handle CRUD operations for project boards, including creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion. Advanced features include member invitation, permission management, and board sharing capabilities.

**Card Operations**
Card endpoints support full lifecycle management including creation, updates, deletion, and file attachments. The API handles card movement between lists and maintains complete activity history.

## 🌟 Usage Examples

**Creating Your First Board**
After logging in, click the "Create New Board" button and provide a descriptive name and optional background color. Your board will be created with default lists (To Do, In Progress, Done) that you can customize immediately.

**Managing Team Collaboration**
Invite team members by clicking the "Members" button and entering their email addresses. Assign appropriate roles based on their responsibilities, and watch as real-time updates keep everyone synchronized.

**Organizing Work with Cards**
Create cards by clicking the "+" button in any list. Add detailed descriptions, set due dates, attach relevant files, and assign team members to ensure accountability and clarity.

## 🔒 Security Features

The application implements industry-standard security practices including password hashing with Bcrypt, secure JWT token generation and validation, input sanitization to prevent injection attacks, and CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include mobile application development, advanced reporting and analytics, integration with popular tools like Slack and Google Calendar, custom board templates, and enhanced file sharing capabilities.
